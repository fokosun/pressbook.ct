3 - You are given the following table in database `nasa`:


CREATE TABLE astronaut ( name text, weight int );


Write a simple PHP page that displays a form to enter the name and

weight of an astronaut and on submission enters those values into the

database. (Simple in this case means you do not have to be 

fancy, but you still need to be complete and correct. Assume the database 

is running on the local host and use user nasa and password nasa to connect).

Use a DB abstraction layer to write your code. Example: PDO or WPDB. Use prepared

statements.
