vagrant up failed due to the absence of Kindlegen gz in the /tmp/ directory.
What I did to try and resolve this:
- I went on amazon to download it www.amazon.com/kindleformat/kindlegen but it is no longer available for download
- Amazon suggests downloading Kindle Previewer instead but that is a .pkg and not a .gz
- I did a google search to see if I can find anywhere online where I can download it but to no avail.
- Next, I tried converting the pkg into gz format with an online too, the problem is the file size is almost 500MB
it costs me money to upload and the conversion for that file size. It will take a long to upload.

My conclusion:
Under the assumption that I was able to access a gz version, the provisioning will be successful
and I will be able to access `pressbooks.test` locally
