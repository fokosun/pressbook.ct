I decided to not pass in an array containing the astronaut name and weight by reference into the add_weight_to_astronaut
method and by value into the launch_astronaut method because the Astronaut class has those properties defined
The name and weight property are set when the make_astronaut command is called. Doing it this way helps track the state
of the Astronaut object and there are getter method present in the class that can be used to fetch the properties.
Also if there is a child class extending Astronaut as a parent class they can access the name and weight properties
by calling the public getter methods.
